# Self-Organizing-Maps

The notebook "implementation_final.ipynb" contains different experiments performed on the data produced by the training of the self-organizing maps.
The visualization are implemented, with comments, in the file "plots.py". 

The file "report.py" contains a report on our experiments and observations, more detailed than the jupyter notebook.
